# AMOGUS GRAND PRIX EDITION DOUBLE BOOSTER PACK EXPANSION PACK & KNUCKLES (Project socoLsocnorT)
Among Us is a game by Innersloth and theres a scratch version this is a memefied open source version of that version.

Innersloth is NOT related with this project.

The project is compiled in TurboWarp and uses their cloudserver.

# Original Scratch Game
TurboWarp Version: https://turbowarp.org/523967150

Scratch: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/523967150

# Why did i made this?
My internet was down and i was bored so i just digged through my drive and finded the grand prix del verano logo and this cool scratch project i downloaded for offline editing and use and so i sayed 'lets splash a ton of grand prix image and he dead text' and then my internet came back next day and forgot about it. I remembered it today after #GrandPrix2023 ended a week ago (Well played Alfacar) so i opened it and finished it and its still horrible XD whoever i cannot upload this to scratch because the default scratch engine is slow and you need to be a scratcher and an account to play so i just sayed 'hey lets give this turbowarp thingy a try' and everyone can now play easily on the line for free and converted to JavaScript makes it 100% faster. 

# Easy Editing
The project will include a folder with both original downloaded version (3.21) with the memefied version for easy use with the scratch editor.

# This project is a meme about Grand Prix Del verano (Yes its Spanish)
EuroTV is not affiliated or working for this project it is just a honorable mention.

Nice Played Alfacar! #GrandPrix2023

# Public or private server?

The public server is connected to the original turbowarp server this project does not change the gameplay behavior and so only textures intro music and such so you can play with this custom client without being accused of cheating.

Private Server connects you to an alternative less busy server.

# Project Status
So people know when the project was under development.

Status: Public

Current State: Build 2 Public and private release
